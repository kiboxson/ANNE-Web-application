# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Frontend-Backend Connection Fix

## The Problem
Your backend URL `https://web-application-ecru-eight.vercel.app` is not responding, which means:

1. **This might be your FRONTEND URL, not backend URL**
2. **Your backend might not be deployed yet**
3. **Backend deployment might have failed**

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Your Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look for TWO deployments:
   - One for Frontend (React app)
   - One for Backend (Node.js API)

### Step 2: Identify Your Backend URL
Your backend URL should:
- Return JSON when you visit it
- Show a message like "Backend API" or "Server is running"
- Have endpoints like `/api/products`, `/api/orders`

### Step 3: Test URLs Manually
Open these URLs in your browser:

**Current URL (might be frontend):**
- https://web-application-ecru-eight.vercel.app

**Possible backend URLs to try:**
- https://web-application-ecru-eight-backend.vercel.app
- https://anne-backend.vercel.app
- https://kiboxson-anne-backend.vercel.app

### Step 4: If No Backend Found
If you don't have a backend deployment:

1. **Deploy Backend Separately:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import from GitHub: `kiboxson/ANNE-Web-application`
   - Set Root Directory to: `Backend`
   - Deploy

2. **Or Deploy Both from Same Repo:**
   - Create two separate Vercel projects
   - One with root directory: `Frontend`
   - One with root directory: `Backend`

## Quick Test Command
Run this to check your deployments:
```bash
node check-deployments.js
```

## Expected Results
- **Backend URL** should return JSON like:
```json
{
  "message": "ðŸš€ ANNE Web Application Backend API",
  "status": "âœ… Server is running successfully"
}
```

- **Frontend URL** should show your React app (HTML page)

## Once You Find the Correct Backend URL:
1. Update `Frontend/.env.production` with the correct backend URL
2. Remove any trailing slashes
3. Push changes: `git add . && git commit -m "fix backend url" && git push`
4. Redeploy frontend on Vercel

## Need Help?
If you can't find your backend URL, you might need to deploy your backend first!
